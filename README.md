🛒 E-Commerce Platform
🌟 Overview
Welcome to the E-Commerce Platform repository! This application is a comprehensive online shopping platform designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience. Built with cutting-edge technologies, the platform offers features for users to browse products, add them to their shopping cart, and complete secure transactions. It also enables administrators to manage products, user accounts, and orders with a user-friendly interface.

The platform integrates email-based account verification, a secure login system with JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and payment gateway integrations with Stripe and PayPal. The application is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, ensuring high performance and scalability.

🚀 Key Features
1. User Authentication & Authorization 🔐
Sign-up & Login: Users can sign up by providing their email, password, phone number, and name. Upon successful registration, they will receive an email verification link. ✉️
JWT-based Authentication: After login, users receive a JWT token, which is used to authenticate subsequent requests. 🛡️
Email Verification: Users must verify their email by clicking a verification link sent to their inbox. ✅ This ensures that only legitimate users can access the platform.
2. Product Management 🏷️
Product Catalog: Admins can add, update, and delete products from the catalog. Products include detailed descriptions, images, prices, and categories. 📦
Search & Filter: Users can search for products by keyword, filter by categories, and sort by price or relevance to easily find what they're looking for. 🔍
3. Shopping Cart & Order Management 🛍️
Cart Management: Users can add products to their shopping cart, modify the quantity, or remove items. The cart is saved and persists until the user logs out or checks out. 💳
Order Placement: Once users are ready to purchase, they can proceed to checkout, where they enter shipping details, apply any promo codes, and choose a payment method. 📦
Order Tracking: Users receive real-time updates on the status of their order (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered). 🚚
4. Payment Gateway Integration 💳
Stripe & PayPal: Integrated with Stripe and PayPal for secure online payments. Users can choose their preferred payment method during checkout. 💵
Transaction Security: All sensitive data is encrypted, and transactions are securely processed to avoid fraud and ensure user privacy. 🔒
5. Admin Dashboard 👨‍💻
User Management: Admins can view, update, or delete user accounts, as well as change their status (e.g., from PENDING to VERIFIED). 🛠️
Product Management: Admins can manage the entire product catalog, including the ability to upload images, set prices, and manage stock levels. 📊
Order Management: Admins can view and manage customer orders, including changing their status, processing refunds, and handling cancellations. 🧾
6. Email Notifications 📧
Order Confirmation: After a successful transaction, users receive an order confirmation email with details of their purchase. 🎉
Password Reset: If users forget their password, they can request a password reset email to regain access to their account. 🔑
Account Verification: A verification email is sent to users after registration, enabling them to verify their email address and activate their account. 🔗
7. Responsive Design 📱
The platform is built with responsive design principles, ensuring that the app looks and performs well across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. 📱💻

🛠️ Technologies Used
The platform leverages a combination of modern frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure smooth operation and a rich feature set.

Backend:
Node.js: The backend is built with Node.js, which provides a fast and scalable runtime environment for building the server-side application. ⚡
Express.js: Express.js is used as the web framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware functionality. It simplifies API development and is highly flexible for building RESTful services. 🔄
MongoDB: MongoDB is the NoSQL database used to store user data, products, orders, and other necessary entities. MongoDB is chosen for its scalability, flexibility, and performance in handling large datasets. 📚
Mongoose: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to interact with MongoDB, simplifying the process of defining schemas and querying the database. 🏗️
Authentication:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWT is used for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the platform by validating the authenticity of user requests. 🔑
bcrypt: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, a cryptographic algorithm designed to securely store passwords. 🛡️
Payment Integration:
Stripe and PayPal: Secure payment gateways are integrated to handle transactions. Both provide users with a choice of payment methods and are widely used for handling e-commerce payments. 💳
Email:
Nodemailer: Nodemailer is used to send email notifications, such as account verification emails, order confirmations, and password reset instructions. 📧
Testing:
Mocha and Chai: For unit and integration testing, we use Mocha (test framework) and Chai (assertion library) to ensure that the platform is reliable and bug-free. 🧪
Deployment:
Heroku / Back4App: The platform can be deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku or Back4App, which support scalable and reliable cloud applications. For local development, MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB instances can be used. ☁️
